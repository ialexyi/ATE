/*
Set the state of the data acquisition mode for single or free-run measurements.
If Measurement is set to On, the 4540 immediately begins taking measurements (Modulated and Statistical Modes), 
or arms its trigger and takes a measurement each time a trigger occurs (Pulse Mode).
If set to Off, the measurement will begin (or be armed) if the Single Sweep menu is selected,
and will stop once the measurement criteria (averaging) has been satisfied. 
If the measurement mode is set to Modulated or Statistical,
no measurements will be made if measurement is set to off.

Set the sensor video bandwidth for the selected sensor. 
The trigger channel bandwidth is not affected.
High is the normal setting for most measurements.
The actual bandwidth is determined by the peak sensor model used. 
Use low bandwidth for additional noise reduction when measuring CW or signals with very low modulation bandwidth. 
If Low bandwidth is used on signals with fast modulation, 
measurement errors may result because the sensor cannot track the fast changing envelope of the signal.
The sensor connected to the channel must support video bandwidth switching. 
This command is not valid for CW sensors or voltage probes.

/*
Set the operating mode of the selected channelís peak hold function. 
When set to OFF, instantaneous peak readings are held for a short time, 
and then decayed towards the average power at a rate proportional to the filter time.
This is the best setting for most signals,
because the peak will always represent the peak power of the current signal, 
and the resulting peak-to-average ratio will be correct shortly after any signal level changes.
When set to ON, instantaneous peak readings are held until reset by a new INITiate command or cleared manually. 
This setting is used when it is desirable to hold the highest peak over a long measurement interval without any decay

/*
Set the RF frequency for the current measurement. The appropriate frequency calfactor
from the sensorÅfs EEPROM table will be interpolated and applied automatically.
Application of this calfactor cancels out the effect of variations in the flatness of the
sensorÅfs frequency response. If an explicit calfactor has been set, either manually or via
the SENSe:CORRection:CALFactor command, entering a new frequency will override
this calfactor and use only the Å\automatic. frequency calfactor.

int		DLLEXPORT	PowerMeter_SetFrequency(int handle,int channel, double Frequency);

/*
Set the trigger mode for synchronizing data acquisition with pulsed signals.
Normal mode will cause a sweep to be triggered each time the power level crosses the preset trigger level in the direction specified by the trigger slope setting. 
If there are no edges that cross this level, no data acquisition will occur.
Auto mode operates in much the same way as Normal mode, 
but will automatically generate a trace if no trigger edges are detected for a period of time (100 to 500 milliseconds, depending on timebase). 
This will keep the trace updating even if the pulse edges stop. 
The Auto PK-PK mode operates the same as AUTO mode,
but will adjust the trigger level to halfway between the highest and lowest power or voltage levels detected. 
This aids in maintaining synchronization with a pulse signal of varying level.
The Freerun mode forces unsynchronized traces at a high rate to assist in locating the signal.

 0 - Auto , 1 - Auto PK-PK , 2 - Normal , 3 - Freerun
